# Steps to Run the Code

This README provides detailed instructions on how to execute the code found in the `src` file of this repository. It also includes guidance on accessing the dataset necessary for running the code, which is crucial if the token to access the S3 bucket has expired.


- Open `src` file
- run `HW02.ipynb`
- If the token to access the s3 bucket was expired, you can uncomment the line that read the `heart_disease.csv` from the data file
